# Basic setup

## How to use
Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

Run with live reloading in Sketch
```
npm run render
```

Or, to install as a Sketch plugin:
```
npm run build
npm run link-plugin
```
Then, open Sketch and navigate to `Plugins → react-sketchapp: Basic skpm Example`

## The idea behind the example

[`skpm`](https://github.com/sketch-pm/skpm) is the easiest way to build `react-sketchapp` projects - this is a minimal example of it in use.
